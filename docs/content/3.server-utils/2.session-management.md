## Session expiration and refresh

Nuxt OIDC Auth automatically checks if the session is expired and refreshes it if necessary. You can disable this behavior by setting `expirationCheck` and `automaticRefresh` to `false` in the `session` configuration.
The session is automatically refreshed when the `session` object is accessed. You can also manually refresh the session using `refresh` from `useOidcAuth` on the client or on the server side by calling `refreshUserSession(event)`.

Session expiration and refresh is handled completely server side, the exposed properties in the user session are automatically updated. You can theoretically register a hook that overwrites session fields like `loggedInAt`, but this is not recommended and will be overwritten with each refresh.

## Using the session in server side code

You can access the user session in your server side code by using the `getUserSession` function from the `@nuxtjs/oidc-auth` module.

```ts
import { getUserSession } from 'nuxt-oidc-auth/runtime/server/utils/session.js'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getUserSession(event)
  return session.userName
})
```

Be careful to not expose any sensitive information from the handler code.
